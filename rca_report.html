                    <h2>Systemic Root Causes</h2>
                    <p class="section-intro">By repeatedly asking "why," we identify deeper systemic causes behind the affordable housing crisis. Each branch explores a different causal pathway.</p>
        <div class="cause-tree">
<h3>Root Cause Lack of affordable healthy food options in low-income areas.</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 0px">
<p><strong>Lack of affordable healthy food options in low-income areas.</strong></p>
<div class="cause-node">
<div style="margin-left: 20px">
<p><strong>1. Systemic inequalities and food deserts: Low-income areas often lack access to grocery stores and farmers&#x27; markets that offer a variety of fresh, healthy food options. This is due to systemic inequalities and discriminatory practices in the food industry, where companies may choose to invest in wealthier areas with higher profit potential, leaving low-income areas with limited options for affordable healthy food.</strong></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 20px">
<p><strong>2. Limited government support and policies: The government plays a crucial role in ensuring access to healthy food options for all citizens. However, in the UK, there is a lack of government support and policies aimed at addressing the issue of food insecurity in low-income areas. This includes inadequate funding for community programs and initiatives that promote healthy eating, as well as a lack of regulations on food pricing and availability in low-income areas. Without proper support and policies, it becomes difficult for low-income families to access and afford healthy food options.</strong></p>
